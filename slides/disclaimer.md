# Disclaimer

### This approach can only be used in exceptional cases

- Explicit usage of SIMD provides much less readable code
- Code is using unsafe and requires extra care
- LLVM with cpu-target native provides decent vectorization

### But

- It might improve performance / reduce costs 2-20 times
